### Hi there 👋 I'm Indy! 

I'm a professional Digital Content Creator based in London. 

After nabbing my degree in English & Professional Writing, I dove straight into the digital sphere full time and have been doing so ever since. My digital background has since spanned everything from a little programming and Photoediting to Interviewing, Content Optimisation and Celeb Ghostwriting. 

I'm fortunate to have had my work used on both commercial and independent platforms all over the world - but I'm not quite done yet! If I can be of service to a creative project you're working on, frankly, I'd be delighted.

💬 I'd love to hear from you!
